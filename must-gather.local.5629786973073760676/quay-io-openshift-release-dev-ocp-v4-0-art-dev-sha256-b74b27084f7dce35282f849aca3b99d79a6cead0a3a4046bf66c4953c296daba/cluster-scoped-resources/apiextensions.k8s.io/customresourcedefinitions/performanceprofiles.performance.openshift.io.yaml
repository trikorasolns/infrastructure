                      option is set to "false", the Isolated CPU set will be static,
                      meaning workloads have to explicitly assign each thread to a
                      specific cpu in order to work across multiple CPUs. Setting
                      this to "true" allows workloads to be balanced across CPUs.
                      Setting this to "false" offers the most predictable performance
                      for guaranteed workloads, but it offloads the complexity of
                      cpu load balancing to the application. Defaults to "true"

                      It is important to notice the CPU manager can choose any CPU
                      to run the workload except the reserved CPUs. In order to guarantee
                      that your workload will run on the isolated CPU:   1. The union

                  CPU set. Setting the option to "false" allows the IRQs to be balanced
                  across all CPUs, however the IRQs load balancing can be disabled

                  values will be set on the node by the performance-addon-operator.
                  It is important to notice that setting hugepages default size to
                  1G will remove all 2M related folders from the node and it will
                  be impossible to configure 2M hugepages under the node.

                description: GloballyDisableIrqLoadBalancing toggles whether IRQ load
                  balancing will be disabled for the Isolated CPU set. When the option
                  is set to "true" it disables IRQs load balancing for the Isolated
                  CPU set. Setting the option to "false" allows the IRQs to be balanced
                  across all CPUs, however the IRQs load balancing can be disabled
                  per pod CPUs when using irq-load-balancing.crio.io/cpu-quota.crio.io

                  It is possible to set huge pages with multiple size values at the
                  same time. For example, hugepages can be set with 1G and 2M, both
                  values will be set on the node by the Performance Profile Controller.
                  It is important to notice that setting hugepages default size to
                  1G will remove all 2M related folders from the node and it will
                  be impossible to configure 2M hugepages under the node.
