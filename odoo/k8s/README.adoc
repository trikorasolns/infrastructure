Odoo on a Kubernetes cluster.

This document describes ths Odoo deployment and maintenance tasks on a

[NOTE]
====
Values for the application version are set on the `odoo-XX.yaml` file located 
 at the link:ansible/defaults[ansible/defaults] folder. When executing the
 Ansible playbooks always add the `yaml` file according to the version being 
 deloyed. _e.g._ `-e "@odoo/k8s/ansible/defaults/odoo-18.yaml"`.

[WARNING]
====
This project assumes that the kubernetes host contains a host variable setting 
 the local folder for the `hostPath` PV folders.

 The variable structure is the following:
