== AWX web first installation stuck on `wait-for-migrations`

=== Problem

AWX web is stuck on `wait-for-migrations`

[source]
----
[wait-for-migrations] Waiting for database migrations...
[wait-for-migrations] Attempt 1 of 30
[wait-for-migrations] Waiting 0.5 seconds before next attempt

=== Cause

ATTOW the cause is not certain, it might be one of 2 causes.

*Possible cause 1*: An existing database is found, probably a corrupt installation that might not have finished.

*Possible cause 2*: Application startup is locked.

=== Solution

*Solution 1* 

Cleanup the database storage contents as a previous installation might be corrupt

*Solution 2* 

Execute `awx-manage migrate --noinput` on the AWX Web container to unblock the installation process.

[source,bash]
